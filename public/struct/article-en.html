    <h2 class="game-title">Frostpunk, the cold, survival and our own contradictions</h2>
    <article>
        <header class="game-article">

        <section>
            <h3>I. Introduction, a frozen world that reflects ours</h3>
            <p>
                Frostpunk is a steampunk city-builder that plunges the player into an icy universe where resources are dramatically limited,
                imposing ruthless management of priorities, every sector is vital but it's impossible to build everything,
                and this constraint turns urban planning into a constant moral dilemma requiring sacrifices
            </p>

            <h3>II. Management under pressure and authoritarian drift</h3>
            <p>
                The new ice age sweeping the 19th century pushes the empire to build generators,
                essential machines whose survival depends on coal, the temperature keeps dropping, storms hit,
                and the player must vote on harsh laws: child labor, endless workdays, triage of the sick
            </p>
            <p>
                The law system works as a long decline of freedoms, offering either strength and repression,
                or religion and comfort, decisions progressively become radical: prisons, propaganda,
                surveillance or organized cults
            </p>
            <p>
                The game turns these levers into political decisions full of meaning, placing the player in the shoes of leaders,
                tempted to sacrifice liberties in the name of the common good, questioning the line between efficiency and ethics
            </p>

            <h3>III. Final judgment and moral warning</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of the campaign, Frostpunk lists your decisions and asks “did we go too far?”,
                alternative endings reward either integrity or pure efficiency, reminding us that surviving is not necessarily a moral victory
            </p>
            <h3>IV. Conclusion, a city-builder that questions our choices</h3>
            <p>
                Frostpunk breaks away from the usual logic of growth and confronts the player with the human cost of every decision,
                the sacrifices it implies, and the persistent temptation of authoritarianism when it seems to save the most lives,
                one question remains: is survival worth all sacrifices?

            <h3>I. Introduction, a dynamic turn-based system</h3>
            <p>
                Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG mixing strategy and real-time action to refresh the genre,
                the player leads a team of explorers tasked with stopping the threat of the Paintress,
                with combat where classic turn planning combines with real-time dodges, parries and counters
            </p>

            <h3>II. Gameplay mechanics and main features</h3>
            <p>
                The combat system relies on hybrid turn-based mechanics: each character has their turn but can chain reactive actions to maximize combos
                and exploit enemy weaknesses, precision and timing are as important as strategic planning
            </p>
            <p>
                Exploration plays an important role: secret areas, optional quests and companions to recruit
                enrich the gameplay and reward curiosity and strategy
            </p>

            <h3>III. Conclusion, an original tactical RPG</h3>
            <p>
                Expedition 33 offers a modern approach to turn-based RPGs, mixing strategy and action that requires precision and reflection,
                despite some repetition and adaptation for purists, the game provides an original and captivating experience

                Blue Prince is an adventure and puzzle game where the player explores Mt. Holly Manor, whose rooms constantly change,
                the main objective is to find the famous “room 46”, navigating an environment that rearranges itself each run
            </p>

            <h3>II. Gameplay mechanics and main features</h3>
            <p>
                The core mechanic is based on building and arranging rooms: when opening a door or placing a plan,
                you choose between several possible rooms, and the placement of doors and objects influences future paths
            </p>
            <p>
                Time is organized into days: the player has a limited number of steps or action points to explore,
                solve puzzles and collect items, at the end of the day the manor partially resets but new rooms become accessible
            </p>

            <h3>III. Conclusion, an innovative puzzle game</h3>
            <p>
                Blue Prince turns level design into the core of gameplay, offering an inventive and demanding experience
                for fans of architectural puzzles and time-based strategy
